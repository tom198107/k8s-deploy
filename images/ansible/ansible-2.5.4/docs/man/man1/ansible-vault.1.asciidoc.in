NAME
----
ansible-vault - encryption/decryption utility for Ansible data files


SYNOPSIS
--------
ansible-vault [create|decrypt|edit|encrypt|encrypt_string|rekey|view] [options] [vaultfile.yml]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
can encrypt any structured data file used by Ansible.
This can include
*group_vars/* or *host_vars/* inventory variables,
variables loaded by
*include_vars* or *vars_files*, or variable files
passed on the ansible-
playbook command line with *-e @file.yml* or *-e @file.json*.
Role variables
and defaults are also included!

Because Ansible tasks, handlers, and other
objects are data, these can also be encrypted with vault.
If you'd like to not
expose what variables you are using, you can keep an individual task file
entirely encrypted.

The password used with vault currently must be the same
for all files you wish to use together at the same time.
